<p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> There's a bunch of edgy stuff in here</p>
<p>Warning for murder, parasites and body horror</p>
<h2>Fruit - 3 January, 2024</h2>
<p>I see all these metaphors</p>
<p>The way to open this fruit</p>
<p>But I never ate this fruit</p>
<p>I do have an outside view</p>
<p>Isn't it cruel to kill gently?</p>
<p>Isn't it better to be killed quickly?</p>
<p>I stare at my organs</p>
<p>The ones that you tore out slowly</p>
<p>I feel pain</p>
<p>I feel it numbing everything else</p>
<p>Make a mess of my corpse</p>
<p>And kill me quickly and painlessly</p>
<hr>
<h2>Parasite - 14 January, 2024</h2>
<p>It's still there</p>
<p>Inside the stomach</p>
<p>You want to pull it out, but you can't</p>
<p>You want it to stop but it stays</p>
<p>It squirms</p>
<p>It feeds</p>
<p>It is so hungry</p>
<p>But you can't blame it</p>
<p>The hunger isn't its fault</p>
<p>You have to feed it</p>
<p>But it still wants more food</p>
<p>Your organs itch</p>
<p>You still can't blame it</p>
<p>It gnaws you from the inside</p>
<p>It bites and it weeps</p>
<p>It kills the being that is sustaining it</p>
<p>And it wants to stop because it can't</p>
<p>It continues feeding but it hurts</p>
<hr>
<h2>Hands - 17 January, 2024</h2>
<p>One hand</p>
<p>Two hands</p>
<p>Three hands</p>
<p>Four hands</p>
<p>It does not matter</p>
<p>I put you down in the dirt myself</p>
<p>With nothing else but bare hands</p>
<p>I put you down like a dog</p>
<p>You beg for mercy when you don't deserve it</p>
<p>You defanged my heart but you didn't get rid of my brain</p>
<p>I put you down the same way you tried to erase my heart</p>
<p>With two hands that hurt and take</p>
<p>You beg for forgiveness but refuse to take accountability</p>
<p>You tell me that it was done to you, so it should be done to me</p>
<p>I dig you deeper into the ground with my bare hands</p>
<p>With two of the hands that you made yourself and gave to me</p>
<hr>
<h2>Door - 8 March, 2024</h2>
<p>It stood in front of my door</p>
<p>It wanted me to open it</p>
<p>I don't want to, but it shrieked</p>
<p>It's as if it pierced my ears</p>
<p>It wants to be let inside</p>
<p>I already saw the news</p>
<p>I know I should call home</p>
<p>But none will mourn me, I know</p>
<p>It's still there, it still wants in</p>
<p>I stare at it observing</p>
<p>It had skin melting off it</p>
<p>Skin that did not belong there</p>
<p>Because I saw it before</p>
<p>When it was shown on the news</p>
<p>It did not have pasty white skin</p>
<p>I won't let it in my room</p>
<p>It added mass to its body</p>
<p>Every time someone let in</p>
<p>So I will stay here and stare</p>
<p>So that others won't have too</p>
