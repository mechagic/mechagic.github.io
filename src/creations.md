If you like any of my stuff, consider supporting me on [KoFi](https://ko-fi.com/mechagic)

[Art](art) - A bunch of my art, some original stuff mixed with some fanart. All of which are categorized by date by yours truly. I like to experiment with it sometimes.

[Writing](writing) - Lotsa, lotsa words. Some are good, some are bad, and some were written by a bug who had a bad day at the time and processed it via writing the horrors.

[Music](music) - A not wise man once said: Sometimes you need to spam notes on beepbox until something sounds good. This is a lot of spamming notes on beepbox.

[Paid Work](paid_work) - Things that people have paid me money to do.
