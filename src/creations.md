If you like any of my stuff, consider supporting me on [KoFi](https://ko-fi.com/mechagic)

[OC Wiki](oc_wiki) - All about my goofy goober OCs :}

[Art](art) - A bunch of my art, some original stuff mixed with some fanart. All of which are categorized by date by yours truly. I like to experiment with it sometimes.

[Pixels](pixels) - I'm not that good at pixel art that much, but it's fun making them anyways!

[Writing](writing) - Lotsa, lotsa words. Some are good, some are bad, and some were written by a bug who had a bad day at the time and processed it via writing the horrors.

[Music](music) - A not wise man once said: Sometimes you need to spam notes on beepbox until something sounds good. This is a lot of spamming notes on beepbox.

[Other Works](other_works) - Stuff I made that don't really fit in the other categories
