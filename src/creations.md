[Pixels](pixels) - My buttons, fonts and other pixel stuff I have made

[Writing](writing) - Lotsa, lotsa words. Some are good, some are bad, and some were written by a bug who had a bad day at the time and processed it via writing the horrors.

[Music](music) - A not wise man once said: Sometimes you need to spam notes on beepbox until something sounds good. This is a lot of spamming notes on beepbox.
