personality: <h2>Personality</h2> New to the world in general, Static has no idea who it is as a person, as such it is generally aimless and often goes with the flow of what's going on around it. <br> It mostly goes with what the others in the group around it do as well. It <b><i>would</i></b> have been really easy to peer-pressure and manipulate, had it not been for the fact that one of it's earliest friendships turned out to be a ploy that would result in its own death. <br> In situations where touch is required, such as hugging, it heavily prefers to be the one to initiate it rather than the other person doing so. Regardless of which incarnation or whatever radio model it is in, the main constant was music and radio dramas
biography: 
abilities: <h2>Abilities</h2>Can reincarnate, however doing so would make it forget everything, making an entirely new person in the process.<br>Post rebirth subconsciously avoids situations that killed it in the past life, it doesn't actively know about this feature of itself.<br>It can't exactly warp reality on a whim yet, the past incarnation was able to but that takes time and experience. As of right now it can warp itself out of danger or awkward situations.<br><br><h2>Reincarnation Cycle</h2><b>Height of smarts</b>- New radio-body has been latched onto. Past incarnation flashes by and reminisces about how things were (similar to terminal lucidity)<br><br><b>Cliff of memories</b>- happens a few hours after the first stage, past incarnation gets wiped, with little knowledge remaining (eg, what killed it in the past life and how to avoid it)<br><br><b>Personality Build-Up</b>- basically starting from scratch, a full identity can take some time to form. In the past it used to take months due to scarce signals. Nowadays it takes a few hours to under a week, whoever it interacts with during this time has a lot of influence over how it acts and what opinions it may have<br><br><b>Diffuse</b>- what happens to all incarnations inevitably, they all slip up at some point, the signals all unfuse due to the destruction of the radio-body, can be slow or fast<br><b>Remeld</b>- Signals begin to coalesce again and find a new radio-body, cycle begins anew. Takes a few days to process and find the new host<br>
