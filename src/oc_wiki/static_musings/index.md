personality: <h2>Personality</h2> New to the world in general, Static has no idea who it is as a person, as such it is generally aimless and often goes with the flow of what's going on around it. <br> It mostly goes with what the others in the group around it do as well. It <b><i>would</i></b> have been really easy to peer-pressure and manipulate, had it not been for the fact that one of it's earliest friendships turned out to be a ploy that would result in its own death. <br> In situations where touch is required, such as hugging, it heavily prefers to be the one to initiate it rather than the other person doing so. Regardless of which incarnation or whatever radio model it is in, the main constant was music and radio dramas
biography: <h2>Biography</h2><h3>Before current incarnation</h3><p><p>The cycle of reincarnation existed since 1894<br>Death comes with a 2nd <s>3rd, 4th, 5th</s> chance. The current incarnation was remelded this year, specifically on 07/07/2024. The signals will eventually coalesce once again and attach itself to another anomalous radio with no memory of who it used to be, practically a reincarnation of sorts... But at that point, is it still the same "person"?</p><h3>Current incarnation</h3><p><ul style="margin-top:0px;"><li>Past Incarnation died<li>Untethered signals go around for a year doing random stuff, best friend of the previous incarnation, Evi, slowly spirals in her grief.<li>A year passes, the signals tethers itself to a new host, Static Musings has been born!<li>After 2 days of mucking about, Static was found by Evi, and was promptly given a new name.<br>Melded Signals. The name of the past incarnation.<li>Evi raises Static under his wing and slowly chips away at its self-esteem.<li>Time passes<li>Eventually Evi gets found out by others OCs regarding their true intentions, being that she plans to use Static Musings to bring back their old friend, which would kill Static in the process.<li>In the aftermath of the event, Static gets recruited by Prominence at the ripe old age of two weeks old.</ul><p>That's about it for now.</p>
abilities: <h2>Abilities</h2>Can reincarnate, however doing so would make it forget everything, making an entirely new person in the process.<br>Post rebirth subconsciously avoids situations that killed it in the past life, it doesn't actively know about this feature of itself.<br>It can't exactly warp reality on a whim yet, the past incarnation was able to but that takes time and experience. As of right now it can warp itself out of danger or awkward situations.<br>Using it's abilities too much would lead to over-exertion, you can read more about this in the "more lore" tab
morelore: <h2>Reincarnation Cycle</h2><b>Height of smarts</b>- New radio-body has been latched onto. Past incarnation flashes by and reminisces about how things were (similar to terminal lucidity)<br><br><b>Cliff of memories</b>- happens a few hours after the first stage, past incarnation gets wiped, with little knowledge remaining (eg, what killed it in the past life and how to avoid it)<br><br><b>Personality Build-Up</b>- basically starting from scratch, a full identity can take some time to form. In the past it used to take months due to scarce signals. Nowadays it takes a few hours to under a week, whoever it interacts with during this time has a lot of influence over how it acts and what opinions it may have<br><br><b>Diffuse</b>- what happens to all incarnations inevitably, they all slip up at some point, the signals all unfuse due to the destruction of the radio-body, can be slow or fast<br><b>Remeld</b>- Signals begin to coalesce again and find a new radio-body, cycle begins anew. Takes a few days to process and find the new host<br><br><h2>Static</h2>The first symptom to show what's about to happen is forgetfulness. The other way to separate the signals is by destroying the radio itself. <br><br> Being overtaken by static hurts it, as that is the one of the only things able to separate the signals, albeit temporarily. It can induce static in itself if forced to overexert it's powers. <br><br> Static Musings is exponential when it comes to being able to overcome the static, too bad it's too scared.<br><br> Closest thing to "getting sick" that could happen with Static would be someone putting too much radio noise over a channel. It's mostly static or pain related.
