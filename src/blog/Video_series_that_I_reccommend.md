        <h3>Unorthodox Kitten</h3>

<b>Thoughts on the series:</b>
Pretty hard to understand but cool to look at, Unorthodox Kitten has a lot of really interesting mathematical concepts inside of it. If you enjoy hard to understand, spooky vibe, eldritch stuff, you'll probably like Unorthodox Kitten's videos.  Also the songs the creator put in the background are really good and fit the visuals well.

        <h3>Bloody Bunny: The First Blood</h3>

<b>Thoughts on the series:</b>
I'll be upfront here: I've never watched any other media related to Bloody Bunny other than this one, and I'll have to say: It is so cool and awesome. The animation, the action, the blood and gore. It's all a feast for the eyes and boy am I begging the waiter for more.

        <h3>Internecion Cube</h3>

<b>Thoughts on the series:</b>
Internecion Cube was Liam Vickers' other series about cool robots that kill each other. Although I haven't watched Murder Drones yet, if you enjoyed that one, you're sure to enjoy this one. Wanna see a weird cube thing speak in japanese and do some cool anime shit? That happens here, go watch it.

        <h3>The June Archive And Restoration Project</h3>

<b>Thoughts on the series:</b>
Wanting to go back to simpler times is something everyone wants to do. This series explores that AND much more. Lotsa good animation and a banger song in one of the episodes. This horror series also doesn't focus much on jumpscares, so when there is one, you'll genuinely be caught off guard

        <h3>Satina</h3>
<b>Thoughts on the series:</b>
Cool animation and really cool backgrounds. I laughed a lot when watching it. I don't laugh a lot ingeneral when it comes to these sorts of things, so I think it's pretty funny. The dynamics between the characters bounce off each other pretty well.
