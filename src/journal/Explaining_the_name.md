Yeah, that's right buddy. I am finally making my first journal post in 2025 on... March the 2nd... Uh oh. Gotta come up with something fast! Luckily I have been thinking of this post for a while except not really because it has been on the backburner ever since I changed the name of this page from a "blog" to a "journal".

Anyways I should stop meandering, as you have probably read from the description of the pervious page, it should probably be the just and all that there is to say. Except! It is not (plot twist amiright?). I'll just list out the reasons as to why it is the way it is.

### 1. Feels less professional
Okay so like Blog feels too business-y to me, probably because my mom used to have one and used it solely for the purpose of getting money via advertisements. As you can see through out this whole website, this is just for funsies and also there are no ads <span class="sml">unless somewhere down the future I add stuff like johnvertising, but that doesn't really count</span>. Woah what was that weird whisper? Okay onto the next reason!

### 2. It's longer
Journal is a longer word than blog and that is important because the other link names on the `Navigation` section of my website feel like they fit in with each other <span class="sml">don't talk about the extras page, I'm planning to change it to miscellaeny in the future anyways</span> Before you say "It still feels shorter compared to the rest", yes I **know** but also this is my own website and I can do what I want with it.

### 3. I like it
It's a word thats got pizzazz y'know? And in the words of our lord and saviour Greg Heffley "*OK, let me get something straight: This is a JOURNAL, not a diary.*" The word diary kinda sucks ass and I don't like it (I am exteremely biased)

And that is the end of this Journal Post, idk how to send these off, g'bye and have a nice day or whatever
