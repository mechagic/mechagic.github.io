I'm going to ramble about something very niche here
I've noticed that in some things, they claim that "gender" doesn't exist but then they turn around and give their characters the same cookie-cutter pronouns we have in our own universe

Which is confusing, because doesn't gender NOT exist here or something? 

I do get the reasoning though, making up new pronouns is hard but I have a few ideas I came up with

Pronouns based on the characters physical appearance
 - eg: A character with green eyes would go by "green/greenself"

Pronouns that are variations of the characters name
- eg: Warren goes by war/warself or ren/renself

Pronouns based on status/profession
- eg: a librarian that goes by book/bookshelf

Pronouns based on the characters personality
- eg: A stealthy character that goes by sly/slyself

I've got more actually, what if the pronouns are given to the characters by their parents? Like how names are given to us by our parents

Okay that's it, bbye
