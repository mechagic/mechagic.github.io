I am tired of everything.

I'm tired that a country I don't live in can influence the one I do live in.

I'm tired that my father that lives in America is a flawed stupid old man that voted for an even more flawed stupid old man 3 times in a row.

It will be fine, it will probably be a fluke as well, the votes aren't done being counted yet.

I just want this to end soon, I am so tired of this.

I eat, sleep, shit, piss, go to school, learn stuff I don't care about and it could all end at any moment, and it's fine I'm fine with this. I'll just keep going forward.

You too, by the way, you should also keep going forward, even if it gets annoying at some point.
