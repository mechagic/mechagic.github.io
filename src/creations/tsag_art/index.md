Concept art for the rewrite of "Stars and Hearts", which has now been renamed to "The Stars Are Gazing". The original only has 3 entries, with only 2 characters introduced and little to no planning involved. I have learned from my mistakes made in the original.

Warning for body horror as well as gore on most of the tabs
