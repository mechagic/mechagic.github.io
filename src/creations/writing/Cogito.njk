<p><strong>Author's Note:</strong>  This is the backstory of my OCs and will eventually be deleted and then reuploaded to the <a href="/creations/oc_wiki">OC Wiki <i class="ph ph-link"></i></a></p>

<center>Your limbs aren't what they used to be, your skin isn't what it used to be, and your luminescence is gone.
<br><br>
You poor soul, what have you done to yourself?
<br><br>
Tore yourself to shreds for the gift of knowledge once every other source of it was drained dry, and yet you won't be able to use it as you are as still as a statue. Unable to move as you lay in stasis.
<br><br>
There's no one else to save you, you don't even know the concept of someone besides you existing.
<br><br>
However it has been something that you have hoped for, has been ever since you made your own language.
<br><br>
You are as still as a statue, and no one will ever save you.</center>
