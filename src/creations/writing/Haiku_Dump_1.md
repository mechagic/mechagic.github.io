Organs on the floor

Umbilical cord cut out

Teeth inside the womb

---

Lost lovers lie down

The forest whispers sweetly

Found dead in the woods

---

Consumption of life 

Unwanted people cry out

No memories mourned

---

Left inside to rot 

The bodies become one soul 

Melted together

---

Toads all over them   

Warts grow out of the body   

Reaching towards sky
