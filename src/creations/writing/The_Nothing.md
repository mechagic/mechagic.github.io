In the beginning there was nothing

And then suddenly after an immeasurable amount of what could be considered time, yet not as you need a something to measure time against, was exactly that.

A something

The something was hard and soft, it had an edge but at the same time it didn't, it was sticky but it didn't stick at all.

There are no words to properly describe it, because no words existed at the time.

The something was different from the nothing in the sense that it had form, the nothing had no form to speak of whereas the something did.

The form was of smell, shape, sight, taste, noise and was of colors that existed and never existed.

After a measurable amount of time, eventually the something separated itself into several other somethings

A something that could paint forms into describable senses, a something that took a describable form, and a something that made sure that the other somethings stayed the same.

Concepts become symbols become archetypes become mortals.

Don't let that happen, don't let the concept of our reality fall apart.
