I burrow into your floors and I hide in your attic, I nibble and eat at the clothes you leave outside, I feed myself using the things you threw away. I am constantly on your mind. I weaken the foundation of your house. I writhe when you spray poison at me, you lived here long before I was born. 

I bite at your fingers when you try to hurt me. You slap me but feed me. You force me in clothes I can't stand to wear. The same clothes that I ate. I am vermin, that is what you think of people like me.

You don't know what I do, but we live in the same house. You tell me about the vermin outside, how they do bad things. I see myself in them. I see how they live when they are accepted by the other vermin.

I bite my fingers when ever you try to speak mean words about them. I itch my nose whenever you order pest control on them. I tell you that I'm one of them, but you push me back into the floors and ignore what I told you.

I dig my claws under my eyes. I tear off my claws with my teeth, and I hide in the attic.
