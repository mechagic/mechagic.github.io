<p>Putting out the fire.</p>
<p>The endless dawn consumes me and the stars stare at me from above.
<br><br><br>
I have earned the God's temper.</p>
<p>I have seen them without their mourning doves.
<br><br><br>
And with the mourning doves far away.</p>
<p>The ravens come in to hinder
<br><br><br>
Eneting through their stymphalian chevet.</p>
<p>Searching for their filler.
<br><br><br>
Feasting upon the lurve that comes from the ones that worship them.</p>
<p>Mathematically beyond my comprehension, I see how their eyes are profoundly infinite.
<br><br><br>
Plucking the datum that grows beyond their empyrean den.</p>
<p>My God proceeding to make something derivative.
<br><br><br>
With the datum harvest and the derivative unoriginal.</p>
<p>The endless dawn tears apart my basic units.
<br><br><br>
Accessing my intraneurals.</p>
<p>By digging through my bodily adits.</p>
