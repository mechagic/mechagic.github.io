Gunpowder smoke, no protection, loaded full of bullets. A man will hunt in the forest

Sunken eyes, pins and needs, blackened skin. A man will be dead in the forest.

Winter cold, scarce food, distant howling. They are hungry in the woods.

Far away in the forest is a wolf embowling. They will be full in the woods.

Rough course fur, the burrowing tics on the hide. The ribs are showing through. Salivating.

Human on the hunt. Gun on the front. Car far in the back. Safety in the far places of mind.

Pointing out the red berry bush, a rifle and a snout. No blood, formerly bloodied, will be bloodied.

A deer hit. A cue for the for what lurks behind. A back slashed.

Went for the shot through deer, not the slashed back man.
<br><br><br>
Laid on the winter cold.

Blackened at the fingertips.

Carcass dragged away.

Wolf disembowling.

Pins and needles.
<br><br><br>
A man was hunting in the forest. The warmth left behind.

A man is dead in the woods. The cold preserving its body.

They were hungry in the woods. They went out hunting.

They are full in the woods. The deer was fulfilling.
