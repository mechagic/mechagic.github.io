Out in the wilderness

You can see it

Down the river that grieves

Past the crumbling gravestones

Under the weeping willows

Where the leaves obscure the sun

Dig through the mud

For it gives us life

See the worms go about

Uncaring if what happens above

---

Take off the seventh skin

Lay to rest the worn hooves

Vulnerable lambs sleep

Skin fresh for the taking

Unsheathe the sharpened claws

Skin the innocent lamb

Put on the black, fluffy fur

And sleep alone with the herd

---

Flower's destroyed with glee

The victims call out "NO"

The culprit cares for none

Black roses torn from stems

White daisies now have thorns

The ruckus came to pause

Loud bang came from wood box

The noise grows ever louder

"A final gift from me"

The culprit said loudly

A wood door swung inside

Newly made vessel shown

The victims watch in fear

The corpse is now alive

---

Take rest on stained bed sheets

Ignore the wailing woods

Put on a mourning face

Make sure the corpse died

Tell the others the truth

Tell them of infection

"The eggs in the body hatched"

You say to the others

"I could not bury the corpse"

You cry out desperately

As they listen to your pleas

The bones in your body shift

The larvae inside nibble

You did not stop what happened

---

Excited for the death of yesterday

I lay down on a green meadow

With no worries left on my mind

I look towards a grey sky

In it I saw nothing

Hands tear at the clouds

I see it bloom

Eyes staring through me

I hold my breath close

Waiting for it to call

And when it hesitated

I slowly closed my eyes to drift

Awaiting for sleep to take me

Excited for the birth of tomorrow
