<p>Out in the wilderness</p>
<p>You can see it</p>
<p>Down the river that grieves</p>
<p>Past the crumbling gravestones</p>
<p>Under the weeping willows</p>
<p>Where the leaves obscure the sun</p>
<p>Dig through the mud</p>
<p>For it gives us life</p>
<p>See the worms go about</p>
<p>Uncaring if what happens above</p>
<hr>
<p>Take off the seventh skin</p>
<p>Lay to rest the worn hooves</p>
<p>Vulnerable lambs sleep</p>
<p>Skin fresh for the taking</p>
<p>Unsheathe the sharpened claws</p>
<p>Skin the innocent lamb</p>
<p>Put on the black, fluffy fur</p>
<p>And sleep alone with the herd</p>
<hr>
<p>Flower's destroyed with glee</p>
<p>The victims call out &quot;NO&quot;</p>
<p>The culprit cares for none</p>
<p>Black roses torn from stems</p>
<p>White daisies now have thorns</p>
<p>The ruckus came to pause</p>
<p>Loud bang came from wood box</p>
<p>The noise grows ever louder</p>
<p>&quot;A final gift from me&quot;</p>
<p>The culprit said loudly</p>
<p>A wood door swung inside</p>
<p>Newly made vessel shown</p>
<p>The victims watch in fear</p>
<p>The corpse is now alive</p>
<hr>
<p>Take rest on stained bed sheets</p>
<p>Ignore the wailing woods</p>
<p>Put on a mourning face</p>
<p>Make sure the corpse died</p>
<p>Tell the others the truth</p>
<p>Tell them of infection</p>
<p>&quot;The eggs in the body hatched&quot;</p>
<p>You say to the others</p>
<p>&quot;I could not bury the corpse&quot;</p>
<p>You cry out desperately</p>
<p>As they listen to your pleas</p>
<p>The bones in your body shift</p>
<p>The larvae inside nibble</p>
<p>You did not stop what happened</p>
<hr>
<p>Excited for the death of yesterday</p>
<p>I lay down on a green meadow</p>
<p>With no worries left on my mind</p>
<p>I look towards a grey sky</p>
<p>In it I saw nothing</p>
<p>Hands tear at the clouds</p>
<p>I see it bloom</p>
<p>Eyes staring through me</p>
<p>I hold my breath close</p>
<p>Waiting for it to call</p>
<p>And when it hesitated</p>
<p>I slowly closed my eyes to drift</p>
<p>Awaiting for sleep to take me</p>
<p>Excited for the birth of tomorrow</p>
