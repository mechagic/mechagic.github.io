Putting out the fire.

The endless dawn consumes me and the stars stare at me from above.
<br><br><br>
I have earned the God's temper.

I have seen them without their mourning doves.
<br><br><br>
And with the mourning doves far away.

The ravens come in to hinder
<br><br><br>
Eneting through their stymphalian chevet.

Searching for their filler.
<br><br><br>
Feasting upon the lurve that comes from the ones that worship them.

Mathematically beyond my comprehension, I see how their eyes are profoundly infinite.
<br><br><br>
Plucking the datum that grows beyond their empyrean den.

My God proceeding to make something derivative.
<br><br><br>
With the datum harvest and the derivative unoriginal.

The endless dawn tears apart my basic units.
<br><br><br>
Accessing my intraneurals.

By digging through my bodily adits.
