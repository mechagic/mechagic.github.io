**Author's Note:** There's a bunch of edgy stuff in here

Warning for murder, parasites and body horror

## Fruit - 3 January, 2024

I see all these metaphors

The way to open this fruit

But I never ate this fruit

I do have an outside view

Isn't it cruel to kill gently?

Isn't it better to be killed quickly?

I stare at my organs

The ones that you tore out slowly

I feel pain

I feel it numbing everything else

Make a mess of my corpse

And kill me quickly and painlessly

## Parasite - 14 January, 2024

It's still there

Inside the stomach

You want to pull it out, but you can't

You want it to stop but it stays

It squirms

It feeds

It is so hungry

But you can't blame it

The hunger isn't its fault

You have to feed it

But it still wants more food

Your organs itch

You still can't blame it

It gnaws you from the inside

It bites and it weeps

It kills the being that is sustaining it

And it wants to stop because it can't

It continues feeding but it hurts

## Hands - 17 January, 2024

One hand  

Two hands  

Three hands  

Four hands  

It does not matter  

I put you down in the dirt myself  

With nothing else but bare hands  

I put you down like a dog  

You beg for mercy when you don't deserve it  

You defanged my heart but you didn't get rid of my brain  

I put you down the same way you tried to erase my heart  

With two hands that hurt and take

You beg for forgiveness but refuse to take accountability

You tell me that it was done to you, so it should be done to me

I dig you deeper into the ground with my bare hands

With two of the hands that you made yourself and gave to me

## Door - 8 March, 2024

It stood in front of my door

It wanted me to open it

I don't want to, but it shrieked

It's as if it pierced my ears

It wants to be let inside

I already saw the news

I know I should call home

But none will mourn me, I know

It's still there, it still wants in

I stare at it observing

It had skin melting off it

Skin that did not belong there

Because I saw it before

When it was shown on the news

It did not have pasty white skin

I won't let it in my room

It added mass to its body

Every time someone let in

So I will stay here and stare

So that others won't have too
