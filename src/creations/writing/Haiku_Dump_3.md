You are flesh and blood

With teeth and a stomach

Hunger is life itself

---

Living a dead life

All the days repeat themselves

Living a safe life

---

Witness death and plague

All the people crying out

Burning their loved ones

---

Sickness prevented

Too late for those left behind

Keeping those here safe

---

Not meant to be here

An unfortunate birthing

Of something deep in

---

Well of infinity

Reborn in a finite world

An angel was born

---

Bring forth new monsters

A shrinking entrance to life

Celebrate rebirth
