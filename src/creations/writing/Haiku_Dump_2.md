Tame pigs and wild boars

Escape to a new frontier

Away from safety

---

Loud trumpets above 

The earth cracks beneath my feet 

Hearing angel calls

---

Feast on loving death 

The rot consumes living flesh 

Maggots destroy sustenance

---

Tower of babel 

Reach towards beloved futures 

We all vainly fall down

---

Language disperse

Hear a mother weep loudly

Seeking is fruitless

---

I hear its loud cries

Begging for loud forgiveness

I do not reach out

---

Eat my uselessness 

Consume my dull sacrifice 

Come undone by teeth
