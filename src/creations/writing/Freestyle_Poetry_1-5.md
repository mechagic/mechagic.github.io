> *11/12/2023*

Nothing else will be left of me 

Bright eyes scorn my mortal body 

Ashes to dust, dust to ashes 

Lay my final breath to pieces 

Beings of higher bouts gaze on 

Everything gone as I lie 

Nothing left on my resting spot

---

> *12/12/2023*

Put out flames of the bright eye's wrath 

Body built out of dust and ashes 

Beings of above stare at it 

Loathing a creature that was not 

Fanning the blazed vessel through night

Hands reach out towards it, no such luck 

Begging forgiveness, love no thoughts 

Nothing left to give, nodding for loathe

> *(below are written in the same date)*

Explore the frozen

The animals not quite right

Echoes put distance

Push off the warnings of old

Without fear, with love

Instill a warmth in the frost

Put down old worries

Take off the old self that yearns

And fly with duty

---

Put off by the mundane

Attending to the unknown

Down in the dark depths

A lone stranger puts on masks

Begging for entrance

Pleading for resurrection

Mundane forgotten

Unknown feasters ensure none left

Lone beings absorb

Forgotten stranger now gone

---

False creatures see through the truth

Embracing the facade

Cry with the already dead

Celebrate with unreal love

Eat through the rotten flesh of the heart

Put down false airs, see the truth

Turn away from the facade
