The concept of communication 

Is a mere child

It lets us speak without the fear of our tongues coming loose

It lets us touch without melting into each other

It lets us form communities without losing our individuality

And yet it will never reach adulthood despite all it has done for us

It won't ever experience community 

If it does

Our tongues will come loose and our touch will melt us into each other
