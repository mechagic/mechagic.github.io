<h2>UNNAMED STORY (original date: 11 December, 2022)</h2>
<p>In the end there was nothing</p>
<p>And then there was something, a faint glimmer of hope that was full of love and life</p>
<p>The glimmer created multiple things</p>
<p>Elav, the first born was bursting full of lively plants and insects, flowers bursting out of its skin. It was beautiful and often praised its siblings for their accomplishments</p>
<p>Surm, the second born was made of fire unlike its sibling Elav, aers skin was charred and hot to the touch and despite being hot always felt cold. Ae loved cuddling with aers siblings in rder to feel warm</p>
<p>And Segadusse</p>
<p>The one born the last and the last to live, their skin was made out of porcelain and their eyes were made out of buttons. The last to be made, the first to die</p>
<p>Segadusse proposed the idea of making other living beings, smaller and weaker than them</p>
<p>The glimmer and their siblings had agreed and created many beings</p>
<p>But one day Segadusse fell sick, and when that day happened a corruption swept across their little worlds</p>
<p>The glimmer and their other children tried to keep Segadusse alive</p>
<p>The glimmer tried giving Segadusse a real body</p>
<p>Elav fed Segadusse the herbs that grew for its body</p>
<p>Surm kept Segadusse warm</p>
<p>But it was all for nothing. Segadusse was dead, and the festering corruption became more and more prominent</p>
<p>The corruption was a disgusting little thing making beings into something they were not for its own sick pleasure. It won’t die and it will stay</p>
