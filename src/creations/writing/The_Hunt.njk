<p>Gunpowder smoke, no protection, loaded full of bullets. A man will hunt in the forest</p>
<p>Sunken eyes, pins and needs, blackened skin. A man will be dead in the forest.</p>
<p>Winter cold, scarce food, distant howling. They are hungry in the woods.</p>
<p>Far away in the forest is a wolf embowling. They will be full in the woods.</p>
<p>Rough course fur, the burrowing tics on the hide. The ribs are showing through. Salivating.</p>
<p>Human on the hunt. Gun on the front. Car far in the back. Safety in the far places of mind.</p>
<p>Pointing out the red berry bush, a rifle and a snout. No blood, formerly bloodied, will be bloodied.</p>
<p>A deer hit. A cue for the for what lurks behind. A back slashed.</p>
<p>Went for the shot through deer, not the slashed back man.
<br><br><br>
Laid on the winter cold.</p>
<p>Blackened at the fingertips.</p>
<p>Carcass dragged away.</p>
<p>Wolf disembowling.</p>
<p>Pins and needles.
<br><br><br>
A man was hunting in the forest. The warmth left behind.</p>
<p>A man is dead in the woods. The cold preserving its body.</p>
<p>They were hungry in the woods. They went out hunting.</p>
<p>They are full in the woods. The deer was fulfilling.</p>
