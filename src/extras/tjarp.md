    <h3>What is this and what does it mean to you?</h3>
    <p>
      The June Archive and Restoration Project is an ARG hosted on Twitter, Youtube and Sudomemo. On the surface it is a normal archive of flipnotes, however things very quickly go... wrong. The videos are being tampered with, not due to someone else editing them, but rather as a result of <span style="background:var(--main2); background-size: 10px 1000px;">time itself being rewound and a memory-virus pulling the strings</span>
      <br><br>
      I have been following it ever since the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WSfA7oXQ6s">E46402_14F62365E17E6_000.ppm</a> was reccommended to me randomly on youtube, and ever since then, it has been rotating in the back of my brain CONSTANTLY. I only follow it on the youtube side of things because of how twitter is but yeah it really is great.

    <h3>Who is your favorite character?</h3>
    <p>
      My favorite character HAS to be the Archivist themselves, despite us never even hearing them through out all this. The certain air of hopelessness they give off and the fact that we even control them during the "Staff Interactions" have really endeared me to them. Of course bonus points to the fact that them saying no to Fuzz's offer and as a result giving us this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WSfA7oXQ6s">banger of a song</a> and what I consider to be the theme for the series as a whole.
      <br><br>
      A bonus fella I have to mention has to be the "Hotdog man", he's the one that says the quote beneath the banner of this webpage, I have a theory that he might be an extension of either Fuzz or The Archivist, also he has a really cool and awesome sword and that's incredibly banger of him.
