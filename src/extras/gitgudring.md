---

### What is this?
A webring for websites with source code that's hosted and/or deployed to other webhosts via any platform that supports git!

It's powered by [Juneish's Webring Code](https://juneish.neocities.org/written/resources/?page=webstring)!

Examples* of websites that belong on the webring are the following

- websites deployed to nekoweb via deploy2nekoweb
- websites deployed to neocities via github actions
- websites hosted on services such as pages.gay and/or github pages

<p>*Just because it doesn't desrcibe your website, doesn't mean that said website doesn't belong here</p>

### What are the rules?

- No porn should be on your website. I'm 17 and I don't want anyone getting into legal trouble.
  - *Artistic nudity is fine so long as there's a warning while mature themes ingeneral are a-okay*
- Your website must have stuff on it.
  - *Stuff like images, a good amount of text, among other things. If it doesn't have those, then you aren't getting in.*
- It has to be hand coded
  - *No wix, google site, carrd or strawpage shenaniganery here*
  - *Websites that are made via an SSG are hand-coded*
- Widget should be on your site prior to being added
- No hate speech or harmful stuff 
- Widget must be somewhere obvious
  - *It can be on your landing page or your webring page, either one works*

### How do I join?

It's simple! 

1. First paste this on the part of your website that has webrings
 <textarea style="margin:0 5vw!important;" class="link"><script defer src="https://mechagic.party/1stylescripts/gitgudring.js"></script></textarea>
2. And then email me at `mechagic@proton.me` with the subject "**Git Gud Ring**" with the following information:
  - Your website's name
  - A link to your website
  - A description of your website
  - Your website's button (optional)
  - Send proof that you have a git repo to see if you're actually eligible for the ring
3. And that's about it!
