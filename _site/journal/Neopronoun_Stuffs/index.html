        <h2>NeoPronoun Stuffs</h2>
        <p>I'm going to ramble about something very niche here
I've noticed that in some things, they claim that &quot;gender&quot; doesn't exist but then they turn around and give their characters the same cookie-cutter pronouns we have in our own universe</p>
<p>Which is confusing, because doesn't gender NOT exist here or something?</p>
<p>I do get the reasoning though, making up new pronouns is hard but I have a few ideas I came up with</p>
<p>Pronouns based on the characters physical appearance</p>
<ul>
<li>eg: A character with green eyes would go by &quot;green/greenself&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Pronouns that are variations of the characters name</p>
<ul>
<li>eg: Warren goes by war/warself or ren/renself</li>
</ul>
<p>Pronouns based on status/profession</p>
<ul>
<li>eg: a librarian that goes by book/bookshelf</li>
</ul>
<p>Pronouns based on the characters personality</p>
<ul>
<li>eg: A stealthy character that goes by sly/slyself</li>
</ul>
<p>I've got more actually, what if the pronouns are given to the characters by their parents? Like how names are given to us by our parents</p>
<p>Okay that's it, bbye</p>
