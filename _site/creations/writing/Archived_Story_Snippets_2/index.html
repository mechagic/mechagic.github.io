<p>Warning for body horror, death (again)</p>

<h2>Journal - 12 April, 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Day One</strong></p>
<p>I have decided to keep notes on the man in the woods, he seems interesting.
My parents keep on telling me that he does not exist and that I should just live with them instead, but they don’t understand.
The best way to describe him is in two words, thin and pale.
He seems so thin that I almost pity him, I might leave food outside for him.
Day Two</p>
<p>I woke up today with a deer carcass on the front porch.
I had to bury it. The stench is still on my clothes.
I caught a glimpse of him in the tree line, he seems to be 5'6
I think that he put it there as a way to thank me for the food</p>
<p><strong>Day Three</strong></p>
<p>It is raining today, and the man is standing outside my door,
I locked it earlier today, I saw that he has no genitalia and that his head is in the shape of an egg that has been cracked</p>
<p><strong>Day Four</strong></p>
<p>He is still there, and he has been talking for a while.
The thing is, I am in my room and there is no windows, it also has a lot of soundproofing
So how he is able to do this I have no idea, I am scared.
I also do not understand what he is saying.</p>
<p><strong>Day Five</strong></p>
<p>He is still here, I am out of my room now.
He has blood on him.
There is deer surrounding the house.</p>
<p><strong>Day Six</strong></p>
<p>The deer have my parents heads on them</p>

<h2>Destruction -  25 October, 2022</h2>
<p>Frog was beautiful but Scorpion wasn’t</p>
<p>Frog’s markings were a sight to behold</p>
<p>Scorpion loved frog, but they also wanted to destroy frog from the inside out with their venom</p>
<p>Frog didn’t know this, frog thought that they were friends.</p>
<p>Scorpion went to the frog’s pond</p>
<p>The Scorpion was finally going to skin the frog</p>
<p>Tail to skin, he slowly punctured the malleable flesh that would soon belong to them</p>
<p>It was done and the frog had no skin left</p>
<p>The scorpion was beautiful but frog wasn’t</p>
