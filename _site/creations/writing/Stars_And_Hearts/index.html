        <h2>Stars And Hearts</h2>
        <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This story that is pretty much a beta version of one that I am currently working on. This doesn't have good writing and is incredibly unplanned. All of these are from early 2024.</p>

<h2>Text Messages at the End of the World</h2>
<p>☆ Do you think?</p>
<p>♡ I don't, that's why we are here</p>
<p>♡ The whole world is going to become worse because of me and I wish I could make it better</p>
<p>☆ I know, also can you not say the &quot;w&quot; word?</p>
<p>♡ Why?</p>
<p>☆ It makes me uncomfortable, considering the whole &quot;star turned person thing&quot;</p>
<p>♡ Oh shit sorry...</p>
<p>♡ You know I hoped that we could be here forever, in this void</p>
<p>☆ That's kind of a bad idea, because then you'd eventually lose yourself down the spiral</p>
<p>♡ That's likely, but isn't that the temptation of it?</p>
<p>☆ Yeah...</p>

<h2>Supernova</h2>
<p>The ground is shaking, and the very stars are weeping. The core of Klias is pushing out the star's organs, the surrounding gravity shoving it back in and compressing its body. A dance of constant pain, fighting both to kill Klias but to also have it live. The fight had started ever since Klias was formed in a dense molecular cloud, and it had only gotten harder as Klias had
gotten older.</p>
<p>Suddenly, just as quickly and just as slowly as the ripping of the universe. It gets cold, the flames of Klias rapidly running out of fuel, the skin collapsed in on itself but yet it is slowly peeling off, revealing a dense core.</p>
<p>A cloud of hot gas comes out from the corpse, a sigh of relief that the pain is finally over and the star can finally rest peacefully.</p>
<p>But something was wrong, and the star woke up in a vast expanse similar to the void, only this time it is green and fuzzy, with a strange grey path stretching out into the distance.</p>
<p>The sky weeps.</p>

<h2>Insignificant</h2>
<p>There are organs in the grass surrounding Klias.</p>
<p>They bleed in ways that it doesn't understand, the bugs underneath its body skitter around in an attempt to get away from the former star.</p>
<p>There's a pain in Klias' body, bumping in a newly born chest, a feeling of liquid rushing under a skin once made of flames that ran so hot, being near them would kill someone.</p>
<p>The grey line made of rock is lifeless, and Klias seeks that feeling. Lifeless is what it used to be. Lifeless is something it will never be again.</p>
<p>It can sense that something has fundamentally changed in it. It used to have a core in the place where the bumping was coming from.</p>
