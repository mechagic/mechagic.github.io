<p>It's important to remember that while your actions before the disaster are important, the preparations you make will be even more crucial to your survival.</p>
<h2>Make sure the exterior is sturdy</h2>
<p>Be sure to check your house for any weak points, if there is a hole to the outside, cover it.
The infected are much more versatile than you think, and some people are infected with a strain that essentially liquefies their bones, which allows them to get through tight spaces.</p>
<h2>Set up your entry points</h2>
<p>Make sure your doors are sturdy and check your windows for cracks. If your doors make a creaking sound, make sure to replace them. A creaking sound may attract an infected, and where there is one, there are usually more.</p>
<h2>Make sure to have a weapon nearby</h2>
<p>Self-explanatory, it's been five months since the infection has gotten out. If you aren't prepared to use a gun, then you aren't prepared to use self-defense when an infected is at your door.</p>
<h2>What if they get in?</h2>
<p>If the infected ever get in your home, it's not your fault. It really isn't. I am so sorry, please don't die, please don't. I am so lonely. The people I love are gone, they went out to get resources for me, I was so useless I am so sorry please forgive me please please please</p>
