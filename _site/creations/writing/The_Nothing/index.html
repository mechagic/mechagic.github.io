        <h2>The Nothing</h2>
        <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong>  This is some concept writing for my OCverse :}</p>
<hr>
<p>In the beginning there was nothing</p>
<p>And then suddenly after an immeasurable amount of what could be considered time, yet not as you need a something to measure time against, was exactly that.</p>
<p>A something</p>
<p>The something was hard and soft, it had an edge but at the same time it didn't, it was sticky but it didn't stick at all.</p>
<p>There are no words to properly describe it, because no words existed at the time.</p>
<p>The something was different from the nothing in the sense that it had form, the nothing had no form to speak of whereas the something did.</p>
<p>The form was of smell, shape, sight, taste, noise and was of colors that existed and never existed.</p>
<p>After a measurable amount of time, eventually the something separated itself into several other somethings</p>
<p>A something that could paint forms into describable senses, a something that took a describable form, and a something that made sure that the other somethings stayed the same.
<br><br><br><br>
Concepts become gods become symbols become archetypes become mortals.</p>
<p>Don't let that happen, don't let the concept of our reality fall apart.</p>
