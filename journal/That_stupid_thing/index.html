        <h2>That stupid thing called &quot;overthinking&quot;</h2>
        <p>I feel like day by day I get more violent but only to a certain extent, I'm sure if I write about violence it will let itself out that way. I just want to make it all end faster, but not in a &quot;stay away from sharp objects&quot; more so a &quot;stay in bed more&quot; way.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I need a therapist, I doubt I'm getting one anytime soon though. My mom says I can &quot;tell her everything&quot; but I've tried telling her things in the past, and guess what: I cannot in fact tell her everything.</p>
<p>She's an oxymoron in that regard, claiming to listen but not. It's annoying actually, almost as annoying as people saying &quot;I don't know&quot; on a discord server when you ask a question.</p>
<p>Worse is, she also doesn't take in any of it and starts saying that what I think is wrong, not even letting me explain myself, she shouts and it's bad and I don't like it very much methinks.</p>
<p>So if the “therapy” option isn’t available, and so is the “mom” option, the third option is ranting to what is either the void, a ridiculous amount of internet strangers, or something in between.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario is a youtuber finding this website and saying I’m cringe, which would have me getting cyber bullied on the internet and this would then have me cause a horrific incident to myself or someone else. This would end with a bunch of people on Tumblr or Tiktok or whatever saying “oh look how we failed this young person guys, lets all get sad about it”</p>
<p>I’m looking too far into the future with that last scenario, making too many assumptions. Someone I know online once told me that I might have anxiety, I don’t think I do. I’m pretty sure I don’t have that knocking around my braincase. I should stop with that and end this blog post here.</p>
