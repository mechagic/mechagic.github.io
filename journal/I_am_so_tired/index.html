        <h2>I am so tired</h2>
        <p>I am tired of everything.</p>
<p>I'm tired that a country I don't live in can influence the one I do live in.</p>
<p>I'm tired that my father that lives in America is a flawed stupid old man that voted for an even more flawed stupid old man 3 times in a row.</p>
<p>It will be fine, it will probably be a fluke as well, the votes aren't done being counted yet.</p>
<p>I just want this to end soon, I am so tired of this.</p>
<p>I eat, sleep, shit, piss, go to school, learn stuff I don't care about and it could all end at any moment, and it's fine I'm fine with this. I'll just keep going forward.</p>
<p>You too, by the way, you should also keep going forward, even if it gets annoying at some point.
